  \textbf{Runtime performance for CPU, GPU, and WSE simulations.}
  \footnotesize
  CPU throughput was measured from NumPy-backed simulation code, GPU throughput was measured from equivalent CuPy-backed simulation code, and WSE throughput was measured from a comparable Cerebras Software Language implementation.
  CPU experiments were single-core on AMD EPYC 7H12 (2.595 GHz), GPU hardware was NVIDIA A100 hosted by AMD EPYC 7713 (2.0 GHz) or Intel Xeon 8358 (2.6 GHz), and WSE hardware was CS-2 hosted by Intel Xeon Platinum 8280L (2.7–4.0 GHz).
  Speedup was calculated relative to mean CPU throughput.
  Shaded areas indicate bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals with sample size $\geq 10$.
